### Inpirational
This repo is inspired by another similar, beginner C program eg repo: [beginners-C-program-examples](https://github.com/gouravthakur39/beginners-C-program-examples).
But however, none of the C files are inspired or copied from that repository.

### Credits

### About
This is my personal project and it contains files that are originally written by me when taking a C programming course. You might notice that these examples are seen everywhere as classic beginner files.
