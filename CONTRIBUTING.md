# Contributing

Thanks for taking a moment ot drop by. There is definetely some terms you should follow when contributing, and here they are:

### Bug
If you noticed an issue in any of the code files (even this file), you can either create an issue, or fix the bug and submit a pull request. 

*Note: When making commit, make sure you make your changes in the code file that is **outside** the `originals` folder. So that we can still keep original copies safely in the `originals` folder. But if admins or authorised contributors make a change, only they can straight commit inside the `originals` folder as this is a personal project but you can make a contribution.*


### Cleaner Code
Of couse there's lots of ways you can make the code simpler, so go ahead (if you can) make a commit and start a pull request. Again, same as above, make sure you make your commit in the file **outside** the `Originals` folder.


### Submit a file
You are definetely welcomed to submit your own C files! As long as they are outside the `Originals` folder that's fine. If you don't see a "Create new file" button, please fork this repo, create a new file in your forked repo and then push your new file to this repo. 

Thanks for reading CONTRIBUTING.md!
