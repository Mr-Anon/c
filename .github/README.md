This repo contains most of my C-files.

Note that all of them are **incredibly easy** for an advanced C developer. For more complicated files, they are in the `big projects` folder.

### Contributing
If you want to contribute, you can **detect issues or help code cleaning**.
Or, you can even add your own C files and make a pull request!

Before contributing *please* read through the CONTRIBUTION.md file. Thank you!
